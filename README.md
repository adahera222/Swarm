Swarm
=====

Swarm is a 2D Shooter game of the Space Invaders/Galaga style. I began with a [tutorial](http://www.unityjumpstart.com/ProofOfConcept_1/) by Casey Jones and have continued to add to it.

The game is implemented in the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) 3D game engine and development system, using JavaScript based language, UnityScript. Since this is a 2D game using a 3D engine, a 2D effect is achieved by putting the camera in orthographic mode, and putting all game objects in the same Z plane.

Plans
-----

The initial version of the game is the result of Casey Jones' tutorial with some minor changes to the scoring, and the addition of an explosion when the player dies. My goal is to produce an iPad version of the game and put it on the iTunes AppStore. My purpose is to primarily to learn the process in order to be able to teach students. If the game sells some copies, that's gravy.

Here is a checklist of what I want to do:
* Add a GameManager object, and move scoring and level control code into it.
* Add lots of comments to the code to guide an inexperienced coder in understanding what's going on.
* Create simple shapes in Blender to replace the cube and sphere from the tutorial.
* Create a texture in Photoshop for the faces of the game objects, and create a cool background.
* Change default gun to continous fire with an overheat/cooldown indicator.
* Add enemies, weapons, power ups, obstacles, and levels.
* Port to iPad and use tilt controls.
* Possibly implement interface to arcade controls.
